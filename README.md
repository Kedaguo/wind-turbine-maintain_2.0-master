#### Introduce
Offshore Wind Power
Offshore Wind Power Repair and Maintenance Online teaching platform is an online teaching platform with the goal of providing comprehensive wind power repair and maintenance knowledge. By combining the latest technology and teaching methods, we aim to provide students with high-quality teaching resources and practical opportunities to help them improve their skills and expertise in the field of offshore wind power repair and maintenance. The platform covers a wide range of course content, including repair and maintenance techniques for wind power equipment, safe operating practices, troubleshooting methods, and more. Participants can practice practical skills through practical simulations. Our practical simulation environment provides a real working environment and equipment simulation, enabling the College to conduct practical operations in a virtual environment and solve various repair and maintenance problems through simulation. Through our online teaching platform for offshore wind power repair and maintenance, students will gain comprehensive knowledge of wind power repair and maintenance, develop practical skills, and lay a solid foundation for their career development in the field of offshore wind power repair and maintenance. We invite you to join us and explore the exciting world of offshore wind!

#### Software Architecture
Software architecture specification
The project is based on Spring Boot and Vue technologies to realize the overall business functions and build an online teaching platform for offshore wind power maintenance and maintenance. On the basis of B/S model architecture, the front-end adopts Vue framework to display page data and render page effects. At the back end, Spring Boot framework is used to realize the business logic and data processing of the online teaching platform for offshore wind power repair and maintenance.
